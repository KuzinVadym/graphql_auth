# users_demo_graphql

Basic Apollo GraphQL demo project which show how to setup server and client side.

Pls first of all pay attention to library versions, 
for now this versions are stable but if you want update main deps (which is pretty normal)
make it step by step,  updating all at once can kost you time and nerves ;) 

next steps: mutations, subscriptions
